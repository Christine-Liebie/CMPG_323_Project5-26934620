In this project a new Power BI Report named ‘Connected Office – Device Monitoring’, was made for stakeholders regarding the newly developed IoT API.

To configure the report, I created three pages:
- ‘High-Level Metrics’
- ‘Device Monitoring’
- ‘Device Registration’

Multiple graphs where created which displays data regarding the devices that are connected. The graphs will help to visually represent what the data is telling us and stakeholders will now be able to make decisions regarding this project.
